## Background

CMS-required outcomes are based on statutory or regulatory requirements and provide a baseline for what is required of a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). These outcomes are outside of the Outcomes-based Planning (OBP) process. This document will focus on State-specific outcomes. State-specific outcomes are developed by states and should be measurable, achievable, and reflect the short-term goals of the MES project.
Metrics provide measurable evidence that the outcomes are achieved on an ongoing basis. States are required to report on the system’s performance to CMS as a condition for receiving enhanced funding.

## Purpose
Document what outcomes are, why you should use the OBP process to develop your state-specific outcomes, how outcomes connect to the MITA 4.0 State Self-Assessment (SSA), triggers and objectives for OBP, and the OBP process.
