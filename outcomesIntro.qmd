## Background

CMS-required outcomes are based on statutory or regulatory requirements and provide a baseline for what is required of a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). These outcomes are outside of the Outcomes-based Planning (OBP) process. This document will focus on State-specific outcomes. State-specific outcomes are developed by states and should be measurable, achievable, and reflect the short-term goals of the MES project.
Metrics provide measurable evidence that the outcomes are achieved on an ongoing basis. States are required to report on the system’s performance to CMS as a condition for receiving enhanced funding.

## Purpose
Document what outcomes are, why you should use the OBP process to develop your state-specific outcomes, how outcomes connect to the MITA 4.0 State Self-Assessment (SSA), triggers and objectives for OBP, and the OBP process.

Purpose of the Outcomes-based Planning Process
1.  Consistent and repeatable process: A structured process ensures that outcomes are identified consistently across the organization, making it easier to replicate, scale and identify trends.
2.  Sustainable: A well-designed process is sustainable and can be applied regardless of the team or individuals involved, reducing reliance on specific people.
3.  Transparency: A clear process provides transparency into the outcome identification process, making it easier to communicate and get consensus and alignment with stakeholders and build trust.
4.  Traceability: A structured process ensures that outcomes are traceable to the original challenge or opportunity, helping to maintain focus and context.
5.  Continuous Improvement: Given that the process improves transparency, it helps to ensure that outcomes are regularly reviewed and refined, driving ongoing improvement.
Other benefits include:
1.  Efficient resource allocation: A well-designed process helps to allocate resources to initiatives that drive meaningful change and align with strategic goals.
2.  Improved accountability: A clear process promotes accountability among team members, as everyone understands what needs to be achieved.
3.  Enhanced collaboration: A structured process facilitates collaboration among stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is working towards common goals.
