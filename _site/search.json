It offers SMAs a clear path to assess maturity, target areas for improvement, and achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\nAlign with Strategic Objectives: Help ensure capabilities directly support SMA goals.\n\nDrive Standardization, Efficiency, and Consistency: Standardize and streamline processes across a SMA.\n\nEnable Effective Transformation: Enable transformative and higher‑quality outcomes with greater effectiveness and performance.\n\nOptimize Resource Use and Integrate with MES Operations: Maximize impact while minimizing waste.\n\nStrengthen Risk Management: Increase the ability to identify and mitigate risks.\n\nEnable Measurable Progress: Provide measures to track improvement over time.\n\n\n\n\nTo create the MITA 4.0 Maturity Model, the MITA Governance Board initiated a MITA SS‑A Maturity work group tasked with the completion of the following deliverables:\n\nDevelop a MITA 4.0 Maturity Model.\n\nDraft a MITA 4.0 Maturity Model Reference Guide that provides an overview of the MITA 4.0 approach to develop the MMM.\n\nCollaborate with other work groups in development of Maturity Criteria for the MMM based on the MITA 4.0 approach to using the state self‑assessment (SS‑A) to assess the maturity of a capability and how well the SMA performs a capability.\n\nCollaborate with other work groups on the development of a high‑level overview of the MITA 4.0 process to aide in understanding how the MMM and the MITA 4.0 SS‑A will be conducted.\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1 – Initiation (Oct‑Dec 2024): Team formation, purpose definition, and socialization of MITA maturity.\n\nPhase 2 – Fact‑finding and Visioning (Nov‑Jan 2025): Research of &gt;60 industry maturity models, visioning sessions, and draft of a MMM scale.\n\nPhase 3 – Finalize MITA 4.0 Maturity Model (Jun‑Oct 2025): Socialize draft scale, gather feedback, and build out levels and criteria.\n\nPhase 4 – Pilot MMM and Supporting Documentation (Nov 2025‑Mar 2026): Pilot with SMAs, gather feedback, and align with MITA 4.0 goals.\n\nThe MMM team selected The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) as the baseline model and extended it to meet SMA needs.\nKey retained features:\n\n5 maturity levels.\n\nDescriptive keywords for each level.\n\n“Non‑applicable” rating option.\n\nAssessment at the capability‑area level.\n\nAveraging of maturity scores across capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nInitial\nCommitment to perform.\n\n\n2\nDeveloping\nAbility to perform.\n\n\n3\nDefined\nThe activities performed.\n\n\n4\nManaged\nAbility to measure and analyze.\n\n\n5\nOptimized\nAbility to implement, improve, and innovate.\n\n\nN/A\nN/A\nNon‑applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1 (Initial): Processes are unstructured, reactive, and inconsistent.\n\nLevel 2 (Developing): Basic processes exist, some standardization, metrics collected.\n\nLevel 3 (Defined): Processes fully implemented, documented, and aligned; metrics actively monitored.\n\nLevel 4 (Managed): Processes operational, consistent, and performance‑driven; organization acts as a thought‑leader.\n\nLevel 5 (Optimized): Data‑driven strategies, predictive decision‑making, continuous improvement, nationally recognized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA capability is an ability that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop to achieve its goals. In MITA 4.0 each capability is composed of:\n\nOutcomes – Desired results.\n\nRoles – Responsible individuals.\n\nBusiness Processes – Activities performed.\n\nInformation – Data and information needed.\n\nTechnology – Tools that automate the capability.\n\nThe Capability Reference Model groups capabilities into:\n\nCapability Domain – High‑level grouping.\n\nCapability Area – Detailed sub‑capabilities.\n\n(Figure omitted – see original document for visual.)\n\n\n\n\nThe state self‑assessment (SS‑A) evaluates maturity of each capability area using the ORBIT framework (Outcomes, Roles, Business processes, Information, Technology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nCulture & Mindset\nCapability\nQuality & Consistency\nAlignment to Goals\nUse of Metrics\nReusability & Integration\n\n\n\n\n1 – Initial\nNo culture of outcomes\nNo internal capability\nAmbiguous, inconsistent\nNot aligned\nNo measurement\nNo reuse\n\n\n2 – Developing\nEmerging awareness\nBasic understanding, vendor‑led\nSome structure, not fully SMART\nEmerging alignment\nInterest but not aligned\nLimited reuse\n\n\n3 – Defined\nIntentional alignment\nSufficient experience, oversight\nDefined approach, variable quality\nIntentional alignment\nRegular reference\nSome reuse\n\n\n4 – Managed\nSystematic, consistent\nFully capable internally\nWell‑established, actionable\nSystematic alignment\nRegular evaluation\nConsistent reuse\n\n\n5 – Optimizing\nEmbedded, high‑quality\nDeep expertise, self‑sufficient\nHigh‑quality, standardized\nSeamless alignment\nEmbedded in continuous improvement\nSeamless reuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Similar table omitted for brevity – see original document for full details.)\n\n\n\n(Content omitted – see original document.)\n\n\n\n(Content omitted – see original document.)\n\n\n\n(Content omitted – see original document.)\n\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 adds personas to make maturity levels relatable and actionable.

    "text": "The MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model is a key component of the MITA 4.0 Framework. The primary objective of the reference model is to support the alignment of capabilities across SMA’s to enable leverage, reuse and interoperability across SMA’s.\n\n\n\nA capability is defined as an ability that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop to achieve its goals and meet its desired outcomes. It represents what the SMA can do without attempting to explain how, why or where the SMA uses the capability. It may be an ability that may exist within the SMA today or be required to enable a new direction or reach a new desired outcome. Each capability is composed of the following: • Outcomes – The definition of the desired outcomes that require the capability to be achieved. • Roles – The individual roles that are responsible for providing the capability. • Business Processes – The business processes that are performed to deliver the capability. • Information – The information and the data management capabilities that are needed to deliver the capability. • Technology – The technology that is used to automate the capability.\n\n\n\nMITA 3.0 defines capabilities as the competence of an individual, organization or system to perform a function or process. The MITA 4.0 framework changes the definition of a capability to not include the concept of competence. The capability in MITA 4.0 focuses only on the ability that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop, agnostic of how well the SMA performs that capability. The purpose of the state self-assessment (SS-A) in MITA 4.0 is to assess the maturity of the capability and how well the SMA performs the capability based on the outcomes, roles, business processes, information and technology that an SMA has defined and implemented to support that capability. The MITA 4.0 capabilities are closely aligned to the following concepts in MITA 3.0: • MITA 3.0 Business Areas and Categories • Technical Service Areas and Classifications\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 vs. MITA 3.0 Capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nA capability reference model is an abstract framework that defines concepts used for grouping capabilities that share a common meaning. It is used to establish a shared definition of capability concepts that cross organizational boundaries and helps to identify opportunities for sharing, leveraging and reuse. The MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model is designed to identify the key capability concepts that are needed to support the Medicaid Program and achieve the goals and outcomes established for MITA 4.0. The MITA 4.0 Capability Model is grouped into (2) levels including: • Capability Domain - High-level capability used to group common capabilities • Capability Area – Detailed capabilities that decomposes the capability domain into sub-capabilities that can be used by SMA’s to classify their capabilities. There are one to many distinct Capability Areas for each Capability Domain. Each Capability Area can have one to many distinct Capabilities defined within it .\n\n\n\nSMA’s will use the MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model to classify their own capabilities. The MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model provides SMA’s the freedom to define their capabilities based on their own state-specific needs. The SMA’s should use the capability domains and areas in the reference model to classify their state-specific capabilities. Using the reference model enables alignment of capabilities across SMA’s and enables states and CMS the ability to do the following: • Identify opportunities to collaborate, leverage and reuse. • Consistently assess and report capability maturity.\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 Reference Model Application Example\n\n\n\n\n\nThe capability domains identified in the MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model are organized into (3) distinct groups including: • Strategic – Identifies capabilities that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop that enable them to establish and maintain its enterprise strategy. • Core – identifies capabilities that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop that enable them to meet its mission and achieve its desired outcomes. • Support – Identifies capabilities that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop that are not specific to its mission but are critical for the core and strategic capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes.\n\n\nUnderstanding the how the MITA Capability Model works is important to obtaining the most value out of many of the other tools and artifacts in the MITA framework, such as the MITA Maturity Model (MMM) and the Business Process Model (BPM). The MITA Capability Model provides a structured way for SMAs to identify, conceptually model, and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations.\nIt is important to note that MITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes. In this way MITA 4.0 provides a reference model for SMAs to model other capabilities that may be needed to achieve their other goals such as state specific outcomes, or other state priorities while providing more guidance within the MITA Framework to support modular.\n\n\n\nMITA 3.0 defined a capability as the level of maturity of a set of business processes within a business category. By focusing on “how” MES operate MITA 3.0 helped SMA’s identify ways to improve and mature their business processes, but it did not link those processes with the outcomes they are intended to achieve or ensure better alignment of the information and technical architectures to business outcomes. The addition of the MITA capability model to the MITA 4.0 business architecture addresses that by providing the conceptual linkages needed to elevate the strategic vantage point of the MITA Framework. To guide this change, we present within this chapter a definition, description, and approach to modeling business capabilities, based on the widely used capability models contextualized for Medicaid Enterprises.\nThe business processes that operationalize MITA capabilities remain foundational to characterizing the business architecture, and are by definition a constituent part of any MITA capability. They provide essential information on how capabilities are operationalize and should continue to be a routinely utilized reference model for SMA business process mapping. They are found with in the Business Process Model chapter of this version of MITA.\n\n\n\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\n\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\n\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\n\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\n\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\n\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\n\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\n\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Application\n\nHow to integrate the capability model into daily operations and strategic planning\nTips for maximizing the benefits of the model\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nEncouragement for ongoing assessment and refinement of capabilities\nLeveraging feedback and performance data for model enhancement\n\nImplementation Guidance\n\nSteps for adopting the capability model\nResources and support available for SMAs\n\nPerformance Monitoring and Reporting\n\nRole of the capability model in tracking and enhancing performance\nUse of metrics and standards to measure capability effectiveness"

These descriptions are necessary so that States can use them as guidelines to define the common data needs that will enable the future business processes of their State Medicaid Enterprises.\nIA Scope\nIt is imperative for the States to review the Business and Information Architectures together. The MITA IA is a set of information system requirements, derived from the BA and fulfilled by the IA, connecting and aligning these two architectures. They are different views of the integrated enterprise architecture.\nJust as the BA business model has sub‑groupings of business processes called business areas, the IA models have sub‑groupings of information called subject areas. The generic term that MITA uses to describe a business area or subject area is domain. These sub‑groupings allow a portion of the model to be viewable as a whole, or the entire model to be viewable at an overview level, thereby eliminating some complexity involved in understanding a large model. All business areas or domains will align across BA and IA (e.g., the Provider Management business area aligns with the Provider domain in the information model).

Solution architects, guided by the information and technical architectural methodologies, work with the business and information architects to maintain this alignment throughout the project. This cooperation continues through full deployment and ongoing operations.\nAs States evolve and begin aligning their technology with MITA, they will see a shift from traditional siloed methodologies to an enterprise approach that includes other health and human service‑related systems.

    "text": "A capability model is a conceptual framework that outlines the key capabilities an organization needs to achieve its strategic objectives. It provides a comprehensive view of what an organization can do and helps identify areas for improvement or investment. In the context of an orchestra, a capability model might help the orchestra identify the set of skills and resources, or other types of capabilities it needs to perform a symphony. Just like an orchestra needs well practiced musicians, sheet music, instruments, a conductor, and an audience to produce a great symphony, a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) needs its Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) to employ or develop specific capabilities to deliver its services effectively, efficiently, and economically to its enrollees and providers.\nThe concept of a business capability is extensively used within enterprise architecture modeling and has been broadly used within Business Capability Models as a tool to better align the business strategy and information technology of both private sector and governmental organizations since they emerged in the mid-2000s. One example comes from the TOGAF Standard, a well-known standard in enterprise architecture. Like most architecture frameworks TOGAF defines a capability as something a business can do to meet its goals. This focuses a strategic lens of an organization on “what” it needs to achieve its goals, rather than “how” those goals are achieved. This perspective allows for business planning from different viewpoints, facilitating strategic alignment and operational efficiency.\nSMA business architects, technologists, systems analysts, executives, managers, and program staff can use this same modeling approach to represent the functional components of their Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) in ways that can help reveal gaps in their systems and provide insights on what new or enhanced capabilities might be needed to close those gaps.\nBy focusing on capabilities, SMAs can better align their information and technology resources and processes with their strategic business goals, ultimately improving their insight into how to improve the outcomes their Medicaid Enterprise Architecture produces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes.\n\n\nUnderstanding the how the MITA Capability Model works is important to obtaining the most value out of many of the other tools and artifacts in the MITA framework, such as the MITA Maturity Model (MMM) and the Business Process Model (BPM). The MITA Capability Model provides a structured way for SMAs to identify, conceptually model, and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations.\nIt is important to note that MITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes. In this way MITA 4.0 provides a reference model for SMAs to model other capabilities that may be needed to achieve their other goals such as state specific outcomes, or other state priorities while providing more guidance within the MITA Framework to support modular.\n\n\n\nMITA 3.0 defined a capability as the level of maturity of a set of business processes within a business category. By focusing on “how” MES operate MITA 3.0 helped SMA’s identify ways to improve and mature their business processes, but it did not link those processes with the outcomes they are intended to achieve or ensure better alignment of the information and technical architectures to business outcomes. The addition of the MITA capability model to the MITA 4.0 business architecture addresses that by providing the conceptual linkages needed to elevate the strategic vantage point of the MITA Framework. To guide this change, we present within this chapter a definition, description, and approach to modeling business capabilities, based on the widely used capability models contextualized for Medicaid Enterprises.\nThe business processes that operationalize MITA capabilities remain foundational to characterizing the business architecture, and are by definition a constituent part of any MITA capability. They provide essential information on how capabilities are operationalize and should continue to be a routinely utilized reference model for SMA business process mapping. They are found with in the Business Process Model chapter of this version of MITA.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the context of MITA, a capability can be defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency to achieve a desired outcome in compliance with the Standards and Conditions within 42 CFR 433.112. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities defined in this way can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\n…a capability is defined as the ability or capacity of a SMA to achieve a desired outcome…\n\n\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and technology resources of an SMA. While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\n\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\n\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\n\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). This may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\n\n\n\nBusiness capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal\n\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components which allows us to reveal gaps not only in the individual components of the architecture, but also understand their impact on the integration of the architecture components at the capability level.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\n\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\n\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\n\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\n\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\n\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\n\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\n\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Application\n\nHow to integrate the capability model into daily operations and strategic planning\nTips for maximizing the benefits of the model\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nEncouragement for ongoing assessment and refinement of capabilities\nLeveraging feedback and performance data for model enhancement\n\nImplementation Guidance\n\nSteps for adopting the capability model\nResources and support available for SMAs\n\nPerformance Monitoring and Reporting\n\nRole of the capability model in tracking and enhancing performance\nUse of metrics and standards to measure capability effectiveness"

Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\n\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\n\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\n\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\n\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\n\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\n\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\n\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction"

    "text": "A capability model is a conceptual framework that outlines the key capabilities an organization needs to achieve its strategic objectives. It provides a comprehensive view of what an organization can do and helps identify areas for improvement or investment. In the context of an orchestra, a capability model might help the orchestra identify the set of skills and resources, or other types of capabilities it needs to perform a symphony. Just like an orchestra needs well practiced musicians, sheet music, instruments, a conductor, and an audience to produce a great symphony, a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) needs its Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) to employ or develop specific capabilities to deliver its services effectively, efficiently, and economically to its enrollees and providers.\nThe concept of a business capability is extensively used within enterprise architecture modeling and has been broadly used within Business Capability Models as a tool to better align the business strategy and information technology of both private sector and governmental organizations since they emerged in the mid-2000s. One example comes from the TOGAF Standard, a well-known standard in enterprise architecture. Like most architecture frameworks TOGAF defines a capability as something a business can do to meet its goals. This focuses a strategic lens of an organization on “what” it needs to achieve its goals, rather than “how” those goals are achieved. This perspective allows for business planning from different viewpoints, facilitating strategic alignment and operational efficiency.\nSMA business architects, technologists, systems analysts, executives, managers, and program staff can use this same modeling approach to represent the functional components of their Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) in ways that can help reveal gaps in their systems and provide insights on what new or enhanced capabilities might be needed to close those gaps.\nBy focusing on capabilities, SMAs can better align their information and technology resources and processes with their strategic business goals, ultimately improving their insight into how to improve the outcomes their Medicaid Enterprise Architecture produces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes.\n\n\nUnderstanding the how the MITA Capability Model works is important to obtaining the most value out of many of the other tools and artifacts in the MITA framework, such as the MITA Maturity Model (MMM) and the Business Process Model (BPM). The MITA Capability Model provides a structured way for SMAs to identify, conceptually model, and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations.\nIt is important to note that MITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes. In this way MITA 4.0 provides a reference model for SMAs to model other capabilities that may be needed to achieve their other goals such as state specific outcomes, or other state priorities while providing more guidance within the MITA Framework to support modular.\n\n\n\nMITA 3.0 defined a capability as the level of maturity of a set of business processes within a business category. By focusing on “how” MES operate MITA 3.0 helped SMA’s identify ways to improve and mature their business processes, but it did not link those processes with the outcomes they are intended to achieve or ensure better alignment of the information and technical architectures to business outcomes. The addition of the MITA capability model to the MITA 4.0 business architecture addresses that by providing the conceptual linkages needed to elevate the strategic vantage point of the MITA Framework. To guide this change, we present within this chapter a definition, description, and approach to modeling business capabilities, based on the widely used capability models contextualized for Medicaid Enterprises.\nThe business processes that operationalize MITA capabilities remain foundational to characterizing the business architecture, and are by definition a constituent part of any MITA capability. They provide essential information on how capabilities are operationalize and should continue to be a routinely utilized reference model for SMA business process mapping. They are found with in the Business Process Model chapter of this version of MITA.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the context of MITA, a capability can be defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency to achieve a desired outcome in compliance with the Standards and Conditions within 42 CFR 433.112. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities defined in this way can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\n…a capability is defined as the ability or capacity of a SMA to achieve a desired outcome…\n\n\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and technology resources of an SMA. While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\n\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\n\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\n\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). This may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\n\n\n\nBusiness capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal\n\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components which allows us to reveal gaps not only in the individual components of the architecture, but also understand their impact on the integration of the architecture components at the capability level.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\n\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\n\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability.

There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\n\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\n\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\n\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\n\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\n\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis.

While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\n\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\n\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\n\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). This may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\n\n\n\nBusiness capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal\n\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components which allows us to reveal gaps not only in the individual components of the architecture, but also understand their impact on the integration of the architecture components at the capability level.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\n\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities."

    "text": "Capability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\n\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\n\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\n\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\n\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\n\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\n\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\n\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction"

Consistent and repeatable process: A structured process ensures that outcomes are identified consistently across the organization, making it easier to replicate, scale and identify trends. 2. Sustainable: A well-designed process is sustainable and can be applied regardless of the team or individuals involved, reducing reliance on specific people. 3. Transparency: A clear process provides transparency into the outcome identification process, making it easier to communicate and get consensus and alignment with stakeholders and build trust. 4. Traceability: A structured process ensures that outcomes are traceable to the original challenge or opportunity, helping to maintain focus and context. 5. Continuous Improvement: Given that the process improves transparency, it helps to ensure that outcomes are regularly reviewed and refined, driving ongoing improvement. Other benefits include: 1. Efficient resource allocation: A well-designed process helps to allocate resources to initiatives that drive meaningful change and align with strategic goals. 2. Improved accountability: A clear process promotes accountability among team members, as everyone understands what needs to be achieved. 3. Enhanced collaboration: A structured process facilitates collaboration among stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is working towards common goals."
