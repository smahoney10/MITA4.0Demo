# MITA 4.0 Implementation Process

This page provides a detailed walkthrough of the MITA 4.0 implementation process, from outcomes-based planning through architecture definition to state self-assessment.

## Process Overview

The MITA 4.0 Process consists of four main steps:

1. **Perform Outcomes-Based Planning (OBP)**
2. **Identify Capabilities**
3. **Define Architecture**
4. **Document State Self-Assessment (SS-A)**

---

## Step 1: Perform Outcomes-Based Planning (OBP) {.tabset}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### a. Identify the Business Challenge

The SMA starts by identifying the business challenge. This could be a new initiative or a problem the SMA is trying to solve (e.g., the trigger for initiating OBP) and describes the "as-is" state.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### b. Identify Goals

Identify the main concern that explains why you are not already at your goal (e.g., something blocking you, something you need to fix, something you haven't done).
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### c. Identify Causes of Concern

Identify the things that cause the concern or make it worse.

- Identify specific pain points that are tangible, real world and observable that you can change.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### d. Summarize Business Challenge

Summarize the concern and drivers in a business challenge statement.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### e. Develop Desired Outcomes

Develop desired outcomes that identify what changes, improvements, or benefits will address the challenges and describe the "to-be" state.

**Sub-activities:**

i. **Reverse-engineer concerns and drivers**
   - State what they would look like when corrected. This is the first step in identifying the "to-be" state. 
   - Example: "Organizations are able to share information electronically."

ii. **Identify the audience**
   - Identify the audience that would benefit from the outcome and the desired result from their perspective.

iii. **Identify needed capabilities**
   - Identify what new or improved capability is needed to correct the concerns or facilitate the drivers
   - Identify the actor to implement the capability

iv. **Summarize in Outcome Statement**
   - Summarize the capability and benefits in an Outcome Statement
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### f. Determine Measurement Approach

Determine how to measure achievement or success. Determine how to measure, monitor, and report on progress to ensure improvements or benefits are reached.

i. **Identify success factors**
   - Identify the success factors that provide the strongest indication of success and why

ii. **Define metrics**
   - For each success factor, corrected driver, and benefit, identify how to measure their status and improvement (either a metric or milestone)
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### g. Define Success Criteria

Define what success looks like and how it can be validated.

i. **Determine time frame**
   - Determine the desired time frame for accomplishing a goal

ii. **Identify target measurements**
   - Based on the metrics associated with the critical success factors, identify target measurements that will indicate success
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### h. Create SMART Objective

Summarize the time frame and metrics into a definition of success. The definition should be framed as a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objective.
:::

## Step 2: Identify Capabilities

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### a. Map State-Specific Capabilities

If already defined, map state specific capabilities to each MITA 4.0 Capability Area. If capabilities are not defined, move to activity 2.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### b. Map Outcomes to MITA 4.0 Capability Areas

Map outcomes from previous step to MITA 4.0 Capability Area, potentially mapping multiple outcomes to one capability areas.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### c. Document Current Maturity Assessment

If applicable, document the latest maturity assessment for those capability areas mapped to outcomes. The capability maturity assessment scores may help to define the projects needed to achieve outcomes. The assessment may also help shape the initial identified outcomes and add more information.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### d. Document Target Maturity

Document the target maturity for each capability area mapped to an outcome.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### e. Update Capability Mapping

Update capability mapping as state specific capabilities are defined and as maturity assessments are conducted.
:::

## Step 4: Document State Self-Assessment (SS-A)

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### a. Document Maturity Assessment Results

**i. Capture maturity assessments**
   - Use the method of your choice to capture all maturity assessments performed in Step 3, Define/Enhance Capability Architecture, of the MITA 4.0 Process
   - CMS offers an optional proof-of-concept SS-A Tool for SMA use in capturing maturity assessments

**ii. Generate Maturity Profile**
   - Use SS-A Tool function to generate a .csv file of the assessment results in the CMS required format, the Maturity Profile
   - If not using optional SS-A tool, compile maturity assessment results using CMS spreadsheet template and save as a .csv file

**iii. Import into MESH**
   - Import Maturity Profile.csv file of maturity assessment results into MESH and notify State Officer that file is ready for review
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### b. Create SS-A Executive Summary

Utilize the SS-A Executive Summary template and Roadmap visual to document the following:

i. Goals of the initiative of project
ii. Prioritized features and functionalities
iii. Potential risks identified
iv. Mitigation strategies to address identified risks
v. A visual timeline (e.g., a Gantt chart or other roadmap format) of the SMA's planned initiatives and projects
vi. Resources and/or support needed for the planned initiative or project
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### c. Review SS-A with Leadership

**i. Submit for review**
   - Submit the SS-A Executive Summary that includes Maturity Profile and draft Roadmap to leadership and request to brief leadership on SS-A findings

**iii. Determine priorities**
   - Based on maturity scores or SMA specific needs, determine leadership's priorities on what to address first

**iv. Review Roadmap**
   - Review leadership priorities with the initial draft of the Roadmap's presentation of initiatives or projects to improve maturity

### d. Update/Define Outcomes

Update/Define Outcomes using Outcomes-Based process for initial priorities:

   - Work with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define desired outcomes or update previously developed outcomes and develop associated metrics

**ii. Assess progress**
   - Use outcomes and related metrics to assess progress toward success
   
   1. **If goal is successfully achieved:** Restart the OBP process to define new goals for next identified priority and work toward continued growth
   
   2. **If goal not achieved:** Continue tracking progress and reassess outcomes for initial priority
   
   3. **Routinely reassess:** Determine if goals have changed
      - If goals have changed, restart the process with new priorities
      - If goals have not changed, restart the process for continued growth

## Summary

The MITA 4.0 Process is an iterative cycle that helps State Medicaid Agencies:

1. Define clear, measurable outcomes
2. Identify and assess relevant capabilities
3. Define current and target architecture states
4. Document progress through State Self-Assessments
5. Continuously improve through measured execution

This cyclical approach ensures continuous alignment between business goals, technical capabilities, and measurable outcomes.
