## Introduction

The MITA State Self-Assessment (SS-A) guides your State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to describe current operations and plan for future improvements. The SS-A helps align your Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) with CMS and State prioritized outcomes, MITA's capabilities (ORBIT), and Federal requirements for enhanced funding.
