## MITA Reference Models Overview

The MITA 4.0 Reference Models provide comprehensive guidance across all architecture domains. These models work together to support capability-based planning and implementation.

### The Four Reference Models

MITA 4.0 includes four interconnected reference models:

1. **Capability Reference Model**: Defines what organizations need to be able to do
2. **Business Reference Model**: Defines how work gets done
3. **Information Reference Model**: Defines what information is needed and how it flows
4. **Technical Reference Model**: Defines technology patterns and standards

## Capability Reference Model

The Capability Reference Model is the foundation of MITA 4.0.

### Purpose
Provides a comprehensive catalog of capabilities needed by state Medicaid agencies to operate their programs effectively.

### Structure

#### Capability Areas (Level 1)
High-level groupings of related capabilities:
- **Member Services**: Capabilities supporting beneficiaries
- **Provider Services**: Capabilities supporting providers
- **Program Operations**: Core operational capabilities
- **Program Integrity**: Fraud, waste, and abuse prevention
- **Financial Management**: Financial and payment capabilities
- **Business Intelligence**: Analytics and reporting capabilities
- **Enterprise Services**: Shared, foundational capabilities

#### Capability Domains (Level 2)
Logical groupings within areas. For example, within Member Services:
- Eligibility Management
- Enrollment Management
- Benefits Management
- Member Communications
- Member Self-Service

#### Capabilities (Level 3)
Specific abilities needed. For example, within Eligibility Management:
- Eligibility Determination
- Eligibility Verification
- Eligibility Renewal
- Eligibility Appeals
- Eligibility Reporting

## Business Reference Model

Defines the business processes that implement capabilities.

### Purpose
Provides standard definitions of Medicaid business processes, supporting consistent process design and facilitating benchmarking.

### Components

#### Business Processes
Step-by-step workflows that deliver capabilities. Each process includes:
- Process description
- Process flow diagram
- Inputs and outputs
- Business rules
- Related capabilities
- Integration points

#### Process Patterns
Common patterns that appear across processes:
- Application and intake
- Verification and validation
- Decision and determination
- Notification and communication
- Appeal and dispute resolution

### Example Business Processes

#### Eligibility Determination Process
1. Receive application
2. Verify identity
3. Collect required information
4. Verify income and assets
5. Apply eligibility rules
6. Make determination
7. Notify applicant
8. Activate benefits (if eligible)

#### Claims Processing
1. Receive claim
2. Validate claim format
3. Verify member eligibility
4. Verify provider enrollment
5. Apply pricing rules
6. Adjudicate claim
7. Generate payment or denial
8. Notify provider

### Using the Business Model
- Design or redesign business processes
- Identify process improvement opportunities
- Support business process modeling
- Define requirements for systems

See [Business Reference Model](businessReference.qmd) for detailed process definitions.

## Information Reference Model

Defines information requirements and data standards.

### Purpose
Provides a common information framework, supporting data consistency, quality, and interoperability.

### Components

#### Data Entities
Key information objects:
- **Member**: Beneficiary information
- **Provider**: Provider demographics and credentials
- **Claim**: Claims data
- **Service**: Service descriptions
- **Authorization**: Prior authorization information
- **Enrollment**: Enrollment data
- **Payment**: Payment information

#### Data Attributes
Key data elements for each entity, including:
- Attribute definition
- Data type and format
- Validation rules
- Source systems
- Usage

#### Information Flows
How information moves between processes and systems:
- Data exchange patterns
- Integration requirements
- Timing and frequency
- Standards applied

#### Data Standards
Applicable standards:
- **HIPAA**: Transaction and code sets
- **FHIR**: Health data exchange
- **X12**: Electronic data interchange
- **HL7**: Health Level 7 standards
- **State-specific**: State data standards

### Data Quality Dimensions
- **Accuracy**: Data correctly represents reality
- **Completeness**: All required data is present
- **Consistency**: Data is uniform across systems
- **Timeliness**: Data is current and available when needed
- **Validity**: Data conforms to defined formats and rules

### Using the Information Model
- Define data requirements
- Ensure data consistency
- Plan data integration

## How the Models Work Together

The reference models are interconnected:

1. **Capabilities** define what you need to do
2. **Business Processes** define how to do it
3. **Information** defines what data is needed
4. **Technology** defines how to enable it

### Example: Claims Processing

| Model | Component |
|-------|-----------|
| **Capability** | Claims Processing - ability to adjudicate and pay claims |
| **Business** | Claims processing workflow, adjudication rules, payment process |
| **Information** | Claim data, member data, provider data, service codes, payment information |
| **Technology** | Claims management system, rules engine, payment system, EDI integration |

## Maturity Reference Model

In addition to the four main reference models, MITA 4.0 includes a Maturity Reference Model that defines maturity progression for each capability.

See [Maturity Reference Model](MITA_4.0_Maturity_Reference_Model.qmd) for details.
