## Introduction to Standards and Conditions for Federal Financial Participation (FFP)

To ensure the effective use of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) at the enhanced 90 percent rate, Medicaid systems must adhere to a set of **standards** and meet specific **conditions** established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). These standards define the technical, operational, and compliance requirements for system design and functionality, while the conditions outline administrative, financial, and procedural obligations that states must fulfill to qualify for funding. Together, these guidelines promote efficiency, interoperability, accountability, and alignment with federal regulations, ensuring that Medicaid systems effectively support program goals and beneficiaries.

### **Standards for Medicaid Systems:**

1. **Efficiency and Effectiveness**: The system must demonstrate the ability to provide more efficient, economical, and effective administration of the State Medicaid plan.

2. **Compliance with Federal Standards**: The system must meet requirements, standards, and performance criteria outlined in the State Medicaid Manual and other applicable federal regulations.

3. **Medicare Compatibility**: The system must integrate with Medicare systems for eligibility verification and claims processing for dual-eligible individuals.

4. **Support for Quality Improvement**: The system must fulfill data requirements for quality improvement organizations under Title XI of the Act.

5. **Modular System Design**: The system must use modular, flexible development approaches, including open interfaces, exposed APIs, and separation of business rules.

6. **MITA Alignment**: The system must align with Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) standards to advance maturity in business, architecture, and data.

7. **Health IT Standards Compliance**: The system must comply with health IT standards, HIPAA regulations, accessibility standards, civil rights laws, and reporting protocols as required by federal law.

8. **Technology Sharing and Reuse**: The system must promote sharing, leveraging, and reuse of Medicaid technologies across States.

9. **Operational Efficiency**: The system must support accurate and timely processing, eligibility determinations, and effective communication with providers, beneficiaries, and stakeholders.

10. **Data Reporting and Transparency**: The system must produce transaction data, reports, and performance information to support program evaluation, operational improvement, and accountability.

11. **Interoperability**: The system must enable seamless coordination with the Marketplace, Federal Data Services Hub, health information exchanges, public health agencies, human services programs, and community organizations.

12. **MAGI-Based Functionality**: Eligibility and Enrollment (E&E) systems must demonstrate acceptable MAGI-based functionality through performance testing.

13. **System Documentation**: Systems developed with 90 percent FFP must include documentation to ensure operability by various contractors or users.

14. **Alternate Hardware Strategies**: The State must consider strategies to minimize costs and challenges of operating software on alternate hardware or operating systems.
